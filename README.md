## Final Conclusion:
To improve the room booking, the focus should be on couples and families. There should be a good strategy to decrease the churning of the Couple and Family customers. From the month of April to June booking cancellation rate is high, there should be a marketing strategy and discount policy. The booking cancellation rate of City Hotel is much higher we should focus on service quality and pricing strategy. The approach should include targeted digital marketing campaigns and personalized promotions to capture their attention.
